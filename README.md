Team Swiftrekt's entry into the iOS App Dev Challenge 2015. Our vision was to build a simple game that demonstrates that potential of using the camera(s) located on the front and back of modern iOS devices to act as a game input device. We succeeded in proving the concept but didn't complete the game before the hackathon finished. That being said, we're working on finishing it up right now, so please take a look and enjoy the game!
